Lucky Player
============

This is an experimental library for controlling, handling and balancing the probabilites, mostly and likely to be used in electronic games. It consists a pool class, a player object contains "luckyness" value, and small controllers that will alter the probability by its base value and the player object.

Since I'm still researching and developing this stuff, there are no API usage documents yet, but you still can have a look of the code in order to figue out what I have wrote in it.

Except noticed, every piece of code is licensed under [MIT license](LICENSE).

人品系統 (III)
=============

這是一個實驗性的程式庫，設計成用來控制、處理和平衡機會率，預期是主要所在遊戲的。裡面有一個機率池、掌控「幸運值」（或者所謂的「人品」）的玩家物件、還有數個根據玩家幸運值和其基數而自動調整的機率控制器。

此程式庫還在初步研發階段，故此尚未有 API 說明文件，如果始終有興趣的話，歡迎隨便查閱裡面的程式。
